    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook reviews five different strategies for a spatial regression model specification search, following the principles outlined in Anselin, Serenini and Amaral (2024) *Spatial Econometric Model Specification Search: Another Look* (DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.10650.86721). Three strategies are forward search strategies, from specific to general (STGE), and two are backward search strategies, from general to specific (GETS). They are based on a range of Lagrange Multiplier test statistics as well as simple asymptotic t-tests on the significance of the spatial parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Familiarity with OLS estimation in *spreg* is assumed, as well as basics of *numpy*, *pandas*, *geopandas*, and *libpysal*. In addition, it is assumed that the **chicagoSDOH** PySAL sample data set has been installed."

    "\n",
    "The main module for spatial regression in PySAL is *spreg*. In addition *libpysal* is needed for data import and spatial weights manipulation, and *geopandas* for data input from a shape file. This notebook is based on version 1.8 of *spreg*. \n",
    "\n",
    "As before, only the needed functions from *libpysal* are imported, i.e., `libpysal.io.open` as `open`, `libpysal.examples.get_path` as `get_path`, and `libpysal.weights` as `weights`. The `OLS`, `GM_Lag` and `spsearch` modules are imported from `spreg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional imports are included to avoid excessive warning messages. With later versions of PySAL, these may not be needed. As before, the `set_printoptions` is used for *numpy* 2.0 and later."

If that is the spatial autoregressive coefficient, then the next step is SLX. However, in the current example, two of the WX parameters are less significant than the spatial autoregressive coefficient, and in that case the next step is the LAG model. The motivation is that the consequences of ignoring a lag term are more severe than ignoring an SLX specification. The AK test in the lag model does not reveal remaining autocorrelation, so the recommendation is the LAG specification. The results are not affected by setting p=0.05."
